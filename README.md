The original version renders server-side, but this version is done completely on client-side and updates automatically based on time. The `What a week, huh?` meme will try to select a timeframe that makes most sense (current time is in roughly the first half of the timeframe). The resulting images are rendered as `png`, so they can be easily saved. Other than the above differences, I wanted to use reimplement the idea using Web Components in order to learn about them.
